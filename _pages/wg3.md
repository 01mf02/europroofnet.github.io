The aim of this WG is twofold: (i) to lower the computational complexity and
increase expressiveness of techniques for the verification of program
correctness, and (ii) to strengthen synergies and interoperability between
different proof systems to combine the benefits of the different methodologies
underlying the proof systems to facilitate formal verification of both software
and mathematics.

### Activities

* Summer 2022: next edition of VTSA at Saarbr√ºcken (Germany) with a focus on proof-generating verification systems

* 10-11 February 2022: [Kick-off meeting](../wg3-meeting1) [Slides & Videos](https://europroofnet.github.io/wg3-meeting1/program) [Report](https://europroofnet.github.io/_pages/WG3/Feb2022/ReportWG3meeting.pdf)
