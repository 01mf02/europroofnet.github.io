Reimbursement for participating to a meeting or school is done after
the event with the following conditions:

- You must be [eligible](../eligibility).

- You must have received an invitation from the e-cost system, and you must have accepted it within 2 weeks after reception.

- You have to book your flight/train/bus and accommodation by yourself as much in advance as possible to get better prices, together with insurance in case of cancelation. You must choose the most economical means of transportation. First-class tickets are not allowed. Taxis are not reimbursed. In any case, the reimbursement for travel cost is limited to 1500 euros.

- For accommodation, meals and travels <=100km, the reimbursement is a daily flat rate fixed by the core group (usually around 120 euros/day depending on the country). Ask the precise amount to the organizers of the event.

- You must sign the attendance sheet during the meeting (only the days spent at the meeting are reimbursed).

- You must provide the tickets and bills of your travels >100km and of your accommodation (at your name and address), and the receipts of your meals (lunch and dinner).

- It is possible to use one's own car if it is less expensive than using flight/train/bus, especially for a group. The reimbursement is around 0.35 euros/km for the driver (ask the precise amount to the organizer). On the other hand, parking, fuel, toll and car rental are not reimbursed.
