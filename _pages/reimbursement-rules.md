Reimbursement for participating to a meeting or school is done after
the event with the following conditions:

- You must be [eligible](../eligibility).

- You must have received an invitation from the e-cost system, and you must have accepted it within 2 weeks after reception.

- You have to book your flight/train/bus and accommodation by yourself. You must choose the most economical means of transportation. First-class tickets are not allowed. Taxis are not reimbursed. In any case, the reimbursement for travel cost is limited to 1500 euros.

- You must sign the attendance sheet during the meeting (only the days spent at the meeting are reimbursed).

- You must provide bills for your travels >100km and accommodation (at your name and address).

- For accommodation, meals and travels <=100km, the reimbursement is a daily flat rate fixed by the Management Committee (usually around 120 euros/day depending on the country). Ask the precise amount to the organizers of the event.

- For travels >100km, you should choose the most economical means and arrange your travel in advance to get low prices.

- It is possible to use one's own car if it is less expensive than using flight/train/bus, especially for a group. The reimbursement is 0.35 euros/km for the driver. On the other hand, taxi, parking, fuel, toll, car rental cannot be reimbursed.
