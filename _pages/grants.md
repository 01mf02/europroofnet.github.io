[Accepted STSMs](../accepted_stsms)

The next deadline for STSM proposals will be in November or December 2022.

**What is an STSM?**

A Short-Term Scientific Mission (STSM) is a research visit of an individual researcher from a country participating in the Action in a different country also participating in the Action. We encourage STSMs, as they are an effective way of starting and maintaining collaborations.

The procedure for proposing an STSM is described in [Annex 2 of the Annotated Rules](https://www.cost.eu/uploads/2022/10/COST-094-21-Annotated-Rules-for-COST-Actions-Level-C-V1.3-.pdf#page=96).

The main points about STSMs are:

- An STSM must be between two different countries which are participating in the Action.
- The typical duration is one or two weeks. We favor short missions so that more people can get funded.
- The financial contribution for an STSM is a fixed grant based on the applicant's budget request and the evaluation of the application by the STSM assessment committee. The grant may not necessarily cover all costs of the visit. The grant only covers travel and subsistence and is transferred after the STSM has taken place.
- Recommended grants:
    - up to EUR 120 for daily allowance (depending on the location)
    - up to EUR 400 for travel.
    - the total may not exceed EUR 4000 (this is a hard limit)
- Proposals should be submitted by the deadlines.

**Eligibility**

Check the [eligibility rules](../eligibility) to know whether you can get an STSM.

**What documents to provide?**

Proposals must be made through the [e-COST system](https://e-services.cost.eu/activity/grants/add?type=STSM) (you need to add a bank account on your profile first). The following documents must be uploaded:

- The application form provided by e-COST which requires:
  - Details of the STSM (title and dates)
  - Goals of the STSM (max 200 words)
  - Working plan (max 500 words)
  - Expected outputs and contribution to the Action MoU [objectives and deliverables](../description) (max 500 words) [clearly indicate the main WG it contributes to]
- A letter from the host confirming that he or she will receive the applicant.
- A quote for the travel.
- A quote for the accommodation.
- A short document justifying the requested total amount.

Be careful to check flight/train tickets and accommodations that you
can modify or cancel for free or at little cost (possibly by taking
some insurance) because EuroProofNet provides you with the requested
grant and nothing more. After acceptance, you are responsible to buy
your flight/train tickets and accommodations by youself. Every expense
above the requested ammount will be at your charge as EuroProofNet
provides you with the requested amount only.

**Selection criteria**

The criteria according to which funding will be decided are in order:
- importance with regard to the research coordination objectives
- inclusiveness target countries
- age
- gender
- team with low resources
- balance over the action life time between people, teams, countries and working groups.

**Preparing your mission**

If your STSM proposal is accepted, you receive a mail saying that you
will be granted the requested amount after your mission once you will
have uploaded your report on the e-cost web site. Meanwhile, you are
responsible to buy the necessary flight/train tickets and
accommodation by yourself, at your own name and address. Be careful to
take flight/train tickets and accommodations that you can modify or
cancel for free or at little cost (possibly by taking some insurance)
because EuroProofNet provides you with the requested grant and nothing
more.

**Advance on mission costs**

This facility is not available at the moment.

**During your mission**

Please keep your travel and accommodation bills. We may request them
after your mission.

**Grant reception**

To receive the grant, a short scientific report must be submitted
through the e-cost system along with the host’s approval of the
report, **within 15 days after the end of the STSM.**

**Changing the dates of an STSM, or cancelling an STSM?**

In case you need to change the dates of an accepted STSM, you need to
inform the STSM coordinators as soon as possible and provide new dates
so that the STSM ends before the end of October.

In case you need to cancel an accepted STSM, you need to inform the
STSM coordinators as soon as possible.

**Acknowledgements in publications**

In publications partly elaborated thanks to the STSM, you have to
acknowledge EuroProofNet and COST as follows: "This publication is
based upon work from COST Action EuroProofNet, supported by COST
(European Cooperation in Science and Technology, www.cost.eu)".

**More questions?**

For any question, please contact the coordinators for STSMs [Danijela Simic](http://poincare.matf.bg.ac.rs/~danijela) (University of Belgrade, Serbia) **AND** [Ambrus Kaposi](http://akaposi.web.elte.hu) (Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary). Please, contact them both in case one is not available.

If you have questions concerning reimbursements, please contact
