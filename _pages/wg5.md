### Description

This WG will explore the employment of machine learning (ML)
techniques on different proof representation formats. In particular,
the working group aims at contributing to the active research field of
ML-based methods for improving the efficiency of automated theorem
proving (ATP) systems in terms of further development of techniques
for proof guidance and premise selection, as well as helping in
identifying concept alignments between different implementations of
the same mathematical objects.

An additional objective is to explore how and to what extent tasks of
computer-assisted reasoning can be extended to proofs that are
represented in (controlled) natural languages. This constitutes an
important step towards broader applicability of reasoning technology
and its accessibility to a wider community of researchers, e.g., in
mathematics.
