The aim of this WG is to contribute to the field of machine-learning-based
methods to improve the efficiency of automated theorem proving systems in terms
of further development of techniques for proof guidance and premise selection.
Furthemore, the group will explore how and to what extent tasks of
computer-assisted reasoning can be extended to proofs that are represented in
(controlled) natural languages.

### Activities

* 4-9 September 2022: [AITP'22](http://aitp-conference.org/2022/) conference, Aussois (France)

* Second half of September 2022: school on [Naproche](https://naproche.github.io/) and controlled natural languages in proof assistants at Bonn (Germany).
