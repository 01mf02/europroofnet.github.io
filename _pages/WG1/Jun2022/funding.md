EuroProofNet can fund the travel to Nantes and the accommodation to
attend the [Women in EPN workshop](../women-epn-2022) and/or the
[Dedukti school](../dedukti-school-2022) on June 24-25 of about 40
participants. The daily allowance for accommodation and meals has been
fixed at 120 euros.

If you want to be funded, you need to:

- [Register](https://e-services.cost.eu/action/CA20111/working-groups/apply) to EuroProofNet if not already done.

- **Before May 22**, send a mail to frederic.blanqui(a)inria.fr with
  * the dates you will be attending (June 24, June 25 or both)
  * a quote of your travel cost (screen capture is fine)

- Notifications will be sent out on May 26. Selected people will
receive an invitation from e-cost.

- Register on the [TYPES 2022 website](https://types22.inria.fr/) as well.

- During the meeting, firm the attendance sheet that will be circulating.

- After the meeting, and within 2 weeks, upload on e-cost a copy of
  your flight/train tickets and of your hotel bill.

You are free to arrive before June 24 (e.g. to attend TYPES) and leave
after June 25 (e.g. to work with some colleagues), but EuroProofNet
will only cover accommodation costs necessary to attend Women in EPN
and the Dedukti school.

The action members who will be reimbursed will be chosen by taking
into account the following criteria in order: importance wrt the
research coordination objectives; inclusive target countries; age;
gender; team with low resources; balance over the action life time
between people, teams, countries and working groups.

For more details, see the [reimbursement rules](../reimbursement-rules).
