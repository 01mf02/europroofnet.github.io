### Description

The goal of this WG is to promote the output of detailed, checkable
proofs from automated theorem provers. For the least expressive
language, the current status is already very satisfactory:
propositional (SAT) solvers nowadays output proofs in a standardised
language, several checkers exist, and many tools embed SAT solvers
using proof exchange to attain high confidence in the integration. The
work is under way for FOL/HOL theorem provers and SMT solvers, but the
expressivity of their input languages renders the task significantly
more complicated, with a higher need of coordination.
