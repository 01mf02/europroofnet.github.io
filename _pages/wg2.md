The aim of this WG is to promote the output of detailed, checkable proofs from
automated theorem provers. Work is under way for FOL/HOL theorem provers and
SMT solvers, but the expressivity of their input languages renders the task
significantly more complicated than e.g., in the propositional SAT world, with
a higher need of coordination.

### Activities

* August 2022: WG2 meeting co-located with the PAAR workshop and a workshop dedicated to sharing libraries of formal proofs during [FLOC](https://www.floc2022.org/) at Haifa (Israel)

* Summer 2022: next edition of VTSA at Saarbr√ºcken (Germany) with a focus on proof-generating verification systems
