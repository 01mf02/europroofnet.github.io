### Description

The aim of this WG is to promote the output of detailed, checkable proofs from
automated theorem provers. Work is under way for FOL/HOL theorem provers and
SMT solvers, but the expressivity of their input languages renders the task
significantly more complicated than e.g., in the propositional SAT world, with
a higher need of coordination.
