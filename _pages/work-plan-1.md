* 20% of the budget will be dedicated to short-term scientific missions (STSMs). STSMs are a very important tool for the action since the development of tools for interoperability is facilitated when people can meet and work together at the same place. A [call for STSM proposals](../grants) will be launched soon.

* For the first year, some schools will be (co-)organized to give EuroProofNet members the knowledge necessary to work on the objectives of the action:

    - On June 24-25, there will be a [school on Dedukti](../dedukti-school-2022) and a [workshop on Women in EuroProofNet](../women-epn), in co-location with the [TYPES'22](https://types22.inria.fr/) conference at Nantes (France).

    - During the summer, there will be the next edition of the school on Verification Technology, Systems & Applications (VTSA) at Saarbr√ºcken (Germany), with a focus on proof-generating verification systems.

    - In September, there will be a school on [Naproche](https://naproche.github.io/) and controlled natural languages in proof assistants at Bonn (Germany).

* Finally, a number of small and big meetings have been planned:

    - On February 10-11, the [kick-off meeting of the WG3](../wg3-meeting1) on program verification at Valencia (Spain).

    - At the end of ~~March~~ May, a WG6 meeting on syntax and semantics of type theory at Stockholm (Sweden).

    - In August 11-12, a WG2 meeting co-located with the [PAAR'22 workshop](https://paar2022.github.io/) and a workshop dedicated to sharing libraries of formal proofs during [FLOC](https://www.floc2022.org/) at Haifa (Israel).

    - On September 4-7, WG5 meeting at the [AITP'22](http://aitp-conference.org/2022/) conference at Aussois (France).
