This meeting will bring together developers and users of the TPTP World, including (but not limited to):

  * The TPTP syntax
  * Anything else in the TPTP World

Specifically, this meeting will look at:
  * Producing TPTP-compliant proof output.
  * Tools for verifying (GDV, Dedukti), visualizing, translating (e.g., to and from Dedukti), TPTP proofs.
  * The new TPTP format for interpretations.
  * Tools for verifying (AGMV), visualizing (IIV), translating, TPTP interpretations.
