## Workshop on Natural Formal Mathematics, and on libraries of formal proofs and natural mathematical language

This joint WG4-WG5 meeting consists of:

- a [Workshop on Natural Formal Mathematics](https://cicm-conference.org/2023/cicm.php?event=natfom&menu=general) (NatFoM) on September 6-7 at Emmanuel College, St Andrew's St, in co-location with the [16th Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics](https://cicm-conference.org/2023/)

- a Workshop on libraries of formal proofs and natural mathematical language described below on September 7-8.

The session on September 7 is common to the two workshops.


## Overall programme

| Day and time | Place | Workshop |
| 6 September 14:00-18:00 | Emmanuel College, St Andrew's St. | [Workshop on Natural Formal Mathematics](https://cicm-conference.org/2023/cicm.php?event=natfom&menu=general) |
| 7 September 14:00-18:00 | TBA | Joint WG4-WG5 meeting |
| 8 September 14:00-18:00 | Department of Computer Science, 15 JJ Thomson Ave | Workshop on libraries of formal proofs and natural mathematical language |


## Workshop on libraries of formal proofs and natural mathematical language, 7-8 September 2023 (joint with [NatFoM](https://cicm-conference.org/2023/cicm.php?event=natfom&menu=general) on 7 Sept.)

We welcome contributions (in the form of short talks, demos or presentations on work in progress) on the topics of library descriptions or on methodologies, algorithms and tools trying to tackle the challenges raised by the development, maintenance, refactoring and search of libraries of formal proofs.
We especially welcome contributions focussing on the role of natural language for formal proof libraries, in a very broad sense: natural language processing as a tool to tackle the aforementioned challenges; 
libraries of formal proofs as training data for large language models and autoformalisation; bridging the gap between formal mathematics and natural language mathematics.
If you are interested in giving a talk, please send your submission and abstract of up to 1 page (excluding references) via EasyChair.


## Important dates
* Deadline for submissions: 23 July 2023
* Notification of acceptance: 6 August 2023
* Camera-ready versions dealine: 20 August 2023.

Accepted abstracts will be made available online.


### Venue
William Gates Building/ Computer Laboratory
Department of Computer Science and Technology
University of Cambridge


### Funding applications

Please note that talks will be in person, therefore at least one author of each accepted submission is expected to attend the workshop and to present the submission in person. 
Funding can be offered for members of EuroProofNet ([membership application](https://e-services.cost.eu/action/CA20111/working-groups/apply) is free).

The EuroProofNet COST action can provide funding for a limited number of participants. Before applying for funding see [reimbursement rules](../reimbursement-rules). 
For funding applications you will need to provide an estimation in EUROS of your transport to Cambridge with screen capture as proof, and with the date of your arrival in Cambridge and the date of your departure from Cambridge (it is possible to arrive a few days before and leave a few days after the workshop but a maximum de 4.4 days will be reimbursed).
If you would like the apply for funding, fill out the details on the registration form.

The registration form will be made available soon.
