Large libraries of formal proofs are becoming increasingly common, and
pose several challenges for the maintenance and upkeep if they are to
be widely useful and remain so.
Specific issues for maintenance include problems such as: ensuring
content is not duplicated, it is organised appropriately, it is
sufficiently general to be useful in other developments, or that a
large library is coherent so different parts can be used together.
Ensuring these properties hold is mostly done by human review, which
while always a useful component can be a limiting factor of
maintenance.
We describe several specific problems that can be addressed with
automated tooling, and give some case studies showing how automation
can help humans review things they may not have the time to look into,
and also help us spot difficult to notice issues.

The interoperability of proof assistants and the integration of their libraries is a highly valued but elusive goal in the field of theorem proving.
As a preparatory step, in previous work, we translated the libraries of multiple proof assistants, specifically the ones of Coq, HOL Light, IMPS, Isabelle, Mizar, and
PVS into a universal format: OMDoc/MMT.
Each translation presented great theoretical, technical, and social challenges, some universal and some system-specific, some solvable and some still open.
In this talk, we survey these challenges and compare and evaluate the solutions we chose.
We believe similar library translations will be an essential part of any future system interoperability solution and our experiences will prove valuable to others undertaking such efforts.
