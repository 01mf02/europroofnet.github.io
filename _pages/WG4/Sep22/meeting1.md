This meeting is part of the [Computational Logic Autumn Summit 2022](https://viam.science.tsu.ge/clas2022/).

**Date:** 23-24 September 2022

**Venue:** [Tbilisi State University, Chavchavadze ave. 1, 0179 Tbilisi, Georgia](https://viam.science.tsu.ge/clas2022/venue)

**Call for talks and participation:** Participation is free and can be
online if you cannot go to Tbilisi. We welcome talks, tutorials,
demos, on library descriptions or on methodologies, algorithms and
tools trying to tackle the challenges raised by the development,
maintenance, refactoring and search of large libraries of proofs. If
you want to give a talk or just attend, please fill in this
[form](https://forms.gle/fNxt1ot2xgUUSfGt5).

**Funding:** EuroProofNet can reimburse the transport to Tbilisi + 60 euros/day for the accommodation on September 23-24 (hotels and meals are cheap in Tbilisi) for a number of participants. Please check [eligibility rules](https://europroofnet.github.io/eligibility/) and [reimbursement rules](https://europroofnet.github.io/reimbursement-rules/) to get more details. Results will be given on August 4 maximum.
