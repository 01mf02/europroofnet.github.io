### Description

This WG aims to develop a comprehensive theory of type theories, which
(1) accounts for its domain-specific variants and the type theories
currently used in computer proof assistants, and (2) allows for the
modular reasoning about their syntax and semantics. To this end, it is
important to bring together researchers of different fields (logic,
mathematics, computer science).
