We strive to ensure better gender balance in the community and we take actions towards this goal. We are working with the cost action CA19122 [European Network For Gender Balance in Informatics (EUGAIN)](https://eugain.eu/) and we implement some of the [best practices](https://eugain.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/EUGAIN_booklet_2022-05.pdf) from the EUGAIN booklet:

- We are committed to using inclusive language.
- We monitor the distribution of funds among action participants and we prioritize funding of underrepresented genders.
- We monitor gender balance within the management roles.
- We promote work done by members of underrepresented genders ([WEPN'22](../women-epn-2022/)).
- We organize training and discussion on unconscious biases and gender-balance issues ([WEPN'22](../women-epn-2022/)).
- We aid parents with finding/ensuring childcare at the events organized by EuroProofNet action.
- We consider gender aspects of our research.

If you are organizing an event within the action or if you have other questions/ideas about how to address gender-balance issues within the action, contact the [gender-balance coordinator](../contact).
