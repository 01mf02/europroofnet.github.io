EuroProofNet is the European research network on digital proofs.

**EuroProofNet aims at boosting the interoperability and usability of
proof systems**.

It is a [COST](http://cost.eu) action started on November 2021 and
already gathering more than [210 researchers](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA20111/#tabs+Name:Working%20Groups%20and%20Membership) on proof systems and formal proofs from [30 different countries](../groups).

EuroProofNet organizes meetings and schools, and provides grants to
its members for short-term scientific missions in another lab or
country.

To join the action, simply
[apply](https://e-services.cost.eu/action/CA20111/working-groups/apply)
