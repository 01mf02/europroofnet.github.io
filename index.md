If testing can reveal errors in computer programs, only formal verification can
guarantee their absence. The highest Evaluation Assurance Levels of the Common
Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation require automatically
checked mathematical proofs of correctness. Proofs are also the basis of
mathematics and many sciences, and thus are very important in education and
research.

In many computer technologies, developers and users rely on standard languages
and protocols for exchanging data and enabling tool interoperability: TCP/IP
for network communication, HTML for web pages, etc. This is however not the
case for formal proofs, which is a major bottleneck for their adoption by the
industry. The main reason is that, currently, proof systems use mutually
incompatible logical foundations. Fortunately, only small parts of the proofs
developed in a system use features that are incompatible with other systems.

Europe is a leading actor in the area of formal proofs: about 65% of the proof
systems of the world are developed in Europe, including the two mostly used
proof assistants, Coq and Isabelle.

This action aims at boosting the interoperability and usability of proof
systems and make formal proofs enter a new era. For the first time, it gathers
all the developers and users of proof systems in Europe. To make the proofs
exchangeable, they will express, in a common logical framework, the logical
foundations of their systems and develop tools for inter-translation of the
proofs developed in individual systems to and from this common logical
framework.
