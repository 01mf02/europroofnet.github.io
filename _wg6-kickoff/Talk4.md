Homotopy type theory is an extension of Martin-Löf type theory with a
new axiom (the univalence axiom) and new type formers (higher
inductive types). As it relies on an axiom, it does not satisfy the
canonicity property of Martin-Löf type theory, which states that every
closed natural number is definitionally equal to a
numeral. Nevertheless, it is now known to have a constructive
interpretation, and several implementations of it have been given.

I will give several examples of computations in homotopy type theory,
related to the homotopy groups of spheres in algebraic topology,
including computations that we haven’t been able to perform yet. I
will not assume any prior knowledge of homotopy type theory.
