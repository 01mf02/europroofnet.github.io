title: Bi-presentable 2-categories and (bilex) 2-sketches
---

Motivated by the study of several 2-categories of (first order) theories (Lex, Reg, Coh, Ex, Ext), we introduce bipresentable 2-categories and show that those provide a solid framework to develop semantics for 2-sketches, and in general describe 2-categories of theories. We define bi-accessible and bipresentable 2-categories in terms of bicompact objects and bifiltered bicolimits.  We prove a bi-accessible right bi-adjoint functor theorem and deduce a 2-dimensional Gabriel-Ulmer duality relating small bilex 2-categories and finitely bipresentable 2-categories. Finally, we show that 2-categories of pseudo-algebras of finitary 2-monads on Cat are finitely bipresentable, which in particular captures the case of Lex, the 2-category of small lex categories. Invoking the technology of lex-colimits, we prove further that several 2-categories arising in categorical logic (Reg, Ex, Coh, Ext, Adh, Pretop) are also finitely bipresentable.
