title: A unifying cartesian cubical set model
slides: Mortberg-mloc-2019-slides.pdf
---

We present a new constructive model of univalent type theory based on
cubical sets. The difference from earlier work on similar models is
that it depends neither on "diagonal cofibrations" nor on connections
or reversals. The key idea is to weaken the notion of fibration from
the cartesian cubical model so that it is not necessary to assume that
the diagonal on the interval is a cofibration. Our notion of fibration
coincides with that of the existing cartesian and De Morgan cubical
set models in the presence of the additional structures of the
respective models. This notion of fibration also gives rise to a model
structure, generalizing earlier work of Sattler to cubical sets
without connections. (This is joint work with Evan Cavallo and Andrew Swan.)
