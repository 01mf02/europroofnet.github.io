title: Type-theoretic signatures for algebraic theories and inductive types
---

In the context of proof assistants, inductive types are specified by signatures
of certain syntactic schemata. More generally, algebraic theories can be
likewise specified by syntactic signatures. I present several type theories
("theories of signatures") where certain closed types can be viewed as
algebraic/inductive signatures. By varying available type formers, we can
describe various classes of algebraic theories, ranging from single-sorted
finite product theories to higher inductive-inductive theories. The type
theories of signatures can be modeled in various categories of algebras; for
instance, we can interpret a quotient inductive signature as an 1-category of
algebras, and a higher inductive-inductive signature as a higher category. Thus,
theories of signatures can be viewed as very simple directed type theories,
where variance issues are avoided by disallowing higher-order functions. I also
describe term algebra constructions: this means constructing initial algebras
from syntactic terms of theories of signatures. This can be used as an
intermediate step in reducing large classes of inductive types to basic type
formers.
