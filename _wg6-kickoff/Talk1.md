title: The Minimalist Foundation as a proposal for neutral constructivism 
---

Just as in the long term the only solution for a sustainable life and development should be the radical one, namely zero emissions and zero wastes, so the search for a neutral position in the foundations of constructive mathematics should be the equally radical one, that is, zero ontological and epistemological assumptions. It is here claimed that the Minimalist Foundation (MF), introduced and developed by the author in collaboration with M.E. Maietti since 2005, completely fulfils this purpose. 

Roughly speaking, MF can be seen as obtained from Martin-LÃ¶f type theory by keeping propositions distinct from sets, by adding a notion of collection, and by avoiding closure principles (as universes and well-orders). Using the three primitive notions of set, collection and proposition also in their dependent form, one gets all other notions, such as element, subset, relation, operation, function. 

MF does not postulate the existence of anything; in particular, it is not an axiomatic theory, and thus no universe of sets is required. Operatively, the word set is used to refer to a certain kind of situation in which one has rules to generate effectively all elements. Similarly for propositions and collections. One can thus observe (not assume!) that sets are closed under usual constructions, such as products and sums. Propositions obey intuitionistic logic, which is explained by a principle of reflection. 

Absolutely no assumptions are made connecting different notions (the only exception could be the principle propositions-into-sets introduced by Maietti in her formal system for MF). In particular, the power of a set is not a set, but a collection; this makes MF fully predicative. Also, MF does not validate the so-called axiom of unique choice. This means that one can talk about Brouwer's choice sequences (again, with no ontological assumptions) as ideal points of a suitable pointfree topology without confusing them with lawlike sequences, rather than expunge them from the domain of constructive mathematics, as Bishop did. 

All common foundations of mathematics are obtained as extension of MF in a modular way. This means that adding a principle, for example LEM, does not affect (in)validity of other principles. This makes MF the ideal framework to determine which principles are necessary to prove certain results (reverse mathematics).
