title: Different provability between Martin-Löf's inductive definitions and cyclic proofs
---

(Joint work with Stefano Berardi, University of Torino, Italy.)

A cyclic proof system, called CLKID-omega, gives us another way of 
representing inductive definitions and efficient proof search. The 
2005 paper by Brotherston showed that the provability of CLKID-omega 
implies the provability of first order classical logic LKID with 
inductive definitions in Martin-Löf's style and conjectured the 
equivalence. The 2017 paper by the authors of this talk showed the 
conjecture is false. The paper considers a statement called 2-Hydra 
in these two systems with the first-order language formed by 0, the 
successor, the natural number predicate, and a binary predicate symbol 
used to express 2-Hydra. The paper shows that the 2-Hydra statement 
is provable in CLKID-omega, but the statement is not provable in LKID. 
This talk improves the proof of the 2017 paper to present a simpler 
proof.
